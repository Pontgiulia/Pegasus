                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p><img class="his" src="img/Konstantin.jpeg" alt="Konstantin Eduard Ziolkowski ">The idea of space rockets was scientifically conceived by two physicists: the Russian Konstantin Eduard Ziolkowski (1857-1935) and the American Robert Hutschings Goddard (1882-1945). On March 16, 1926, Goddard launched the first rocket powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen. <img class="his2" src="img/Robert.jpeg" alt="Robert Hutschings Goddard"></p>
                    <p>Five years later, on March 13, 1931, the German engineer Reinhold Tiling managed to patent a technology later rediscovered by astronautics: the reusable rocket, powered by solid propellant.</p>
                    <p>Tiling was a visionary. His rocket launched on March 31, 1931 reached a height of almost 300 meters, when he opened his wings to land softly. The engineer planned to carry out, via rocket, mail services between the mainland and the East Frisian islands in northern Germany.</p>

                    <p>Despite being relatively new, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic gained the spotlight for being created by billionaires and aerospace enthusiasts.</p>
                    <p>And competition for the new space race is fierce. SpaceX, by Elon Musk, and Blue Origin, by Jeff Bezos, face each other in court in a fight over contracts and mutual public stings of the two billionaires. Boeing and Embraer recently lost more than 3,000 professionals to Musk and Bezos' companies.</p>

                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>A space rocket is a means of transport for taking astronauts, equipment and satellites into Earth orbit (or out into space). To fulfill this purpose, the ship needs a jet engine</p>
                    <p>It's just that there's no oxygen in space, so you can't use conventional engines. To get around this, fuels charge your oxygen supply. Without this, combustion would not take place. And the ship would stay in place.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="Rockets">
                    <h2>Rockets</h2>
                    <p>There are three types of rocket, classified according to the type of fuel used. They are:</p>
                        <h3>Solid fuel rocket</h3>
                        <p>Compacted powder with a mixture of dry fuels and strong oxidizers, capable of releasing a lot of oxygen on combustion;</p>
                        <h3>Liquid fuel rocket</h3>
                        <p>Chambers separate fuels from oxidants, which only mix during ignition (when the rocket “turns on”). The most commonly used are hydrazine and liquid hydrogen.</p>
                        <h3>Hybrid fuel rocket</h3>
                        <p>Fuels and oxidants are in separate chambers and in different states (liquid/solid or gaseous/solid).</p>
                        <h3>Use of rockets for society</h3>
                        <p>This type of operation is of great importance for space exploration, astronomical research, telecommunications and also for the development of new navigation and propulsion systems, among others. Rockets are used to take astronauts and equipment to Earth orbit or beyond.</p>
                        <h3>Starship Rockets</h3>
                        <p>The complete vehicle architecture includes both launch vehicles and spacecraft that are intended to completely replace all of SpaceX's space hardware in the early 2020s, as well as ground infrastructure for rapid launch and relaunch, and transfer technology of fuels in zero gravity, to be deployed in low Earth orbit (LEO). The large payload for Earth orbit is up to 150 000 kg which makes Starship a super heavy-lift launch vehicle.</p>
                        <p>Including capabilities to support long-duration spaceflight in a cislunar environment and transport to Mars.</p>
                        <p>The ITS vehicle had been designed with a core diameter of 12m, while the Starship design was reduced to 9m, carrying only half the payload to LEO with just 42% takeoff thrust.</p>

                    <h2>Inspiration for the rocket</h2>
                    <p>The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV was a project started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organization to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. The project was led by APJ Abdul Kalam. The SLV was intended to reach a height of 400 km and carry a payload of 40 kg. It was a four-stage rocket with all solid propellant engines.</p>
                    <p>The first SLV launch took place in Sriharikota on August 10, 1979. The last SLV launch took place on April 17, 1983.</p>
